# FIREBASE VERSION OF CHAT APP
## It is the terminal messenger developed by Peter Repiev
### Here you can chat with whoever you want. Just give your name and go ahead!
##### This project is still in the development and 100% working and completed version is firebaseversion.py but FULL version of firemess is in fbvFULL.py
#### First of all download all files through *git clone https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv.git* or by pressing "download zip" button (https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv/archive/main.zip)
#### To start you need to install all needed Python moduls by printing:
##### Windows
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
#maybe it won't work and you'll need to install all modules in old way
```
##### Linux
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
#### and then with a short command
##### Windows:
```python
>cd fbv
>cd specVERS
py firebaseversion.py
```
##### Linux:
```python
>cd fbv/
python3 fbvFULL.py
```
#### Notes: 
###### if you're on windows and you're having some problems contact me by https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv/issues 
#### You can launch the Messenger and start chatting
You can print
```python
/clear
```
and all chat history will be deleted.
With
```python

```
you can print 👍, 👎 or 😂.
Also there's ability for editing
```python
/edit 14:08:08 (message's time) john (your name) blablabla (new text)
```
